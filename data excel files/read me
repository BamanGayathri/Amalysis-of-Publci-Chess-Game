I have defined a Python function in Google Colab to convert .pgn data of around 1000 games to Excel sheets with required columns, which are used in Tableau to show the visuals and results.
Below are the excel files with the columns and the numbered metrics that are required for this visualization:
	Games.xls - game_id ; lichess_game_id ; site ; date ; round ; white ; black ; white_elo ; black_elo ; winner; pgn ; eco.

	Players.xls - player_id ; name
	Moes.xls - move_id ; game_id ; move_number; move.
